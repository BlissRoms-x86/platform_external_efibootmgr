- Until we can get the ACPI HID and UID programatically, make the user
  pass them in when creating a netboot entry.
- Add O_DIRECT support for reading the disk.

  values were printed in reverse order.
- Fix the README file to reflect all the options that can be passed, and
  add a new item for netboot entries.
- whitespace cleanups

* Fri Oct 25 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- trivial patch from Fabien Lebaillif - Delamare <fabien@quadric.com>
  increases the length of the boot option description from 40 to 64 bytes.

* Tue Oct 22 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- ran docbook2man on the man page Dann Frazier created
- Added man page to spec file
- Added patches from Dann Frazier
  - Removes the requirement to be root to run efibootmgr.  This lets
    mortal users run efibootmgr to check the version, and see the
    --help output. It should also allow efibootmgr to work under
    security systems without the strict root/non-root dichotomy.
    - Checks to see if a boot option was specified when a boot option
    deletion was requested.
- Released version 0.4.1

* Sun Jul 21 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Added kernel_has_blkgetsize64() test, now uses BLKGETSIZE64 if on a
  known-good kernel.  This is important when the Large Block Device (64-bit
  block address) patch gets merged into the 2.5 kernel.

* Wed May 1 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Released version 0.4.0

* Tue Apr 30 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Added some printfs to compare_gpts().

* Mon Apr 08 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Make sure partition number arg is in the GPT disk.
- Added a few more _FILE_OFFSET_BITS defines where needed

* Fri Apr 05 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Added syncs to make tarball target so NFS is current and CVS dirs get
  deleted before the tarball is made.
- Added a few __leXX_to_cpu() calls in code currently commented out in gpt.c

* Tue Apr 02 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- finished conversion to GPT code

* Sat Mar 30 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- began conversion to GPT code in post-2.4.18 and post-2.5.7 kernels.
- added manpage contributed by dannf@fc.hp.com

* Mon Feb 11 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- BLKGETSIZE64 is fixed in 2.4.18-pre8 and 2.5.4-pre3.  Wait a bit longer
before using though.
- added list_for_each_safe() routine.  It's needed in the boot
var deletion routine, though it was already breaking out once found.
- changed struct list_head to list_t
- released v0.4.0-test4

* Fri Jan 18 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- commented out BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl use for now.  Kernels 2.4.15-2.4.18 and
  2.5.0-2.5.3 don't return the right value.

* Thu Jan 3 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- added back in read last sector IOCTL hack, but only after read() fails.
- released v0.4.0-test4

* Thu Jan 3 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- more cleanups
- released v0.4.0-test3

* Wed Jan 2 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Changed PROC_DIR_EFI to PROC_DIR_EFI_VARS
- write_variable() now searches /proc/efi/vars for a variable that's not
  the one being written.  The EFI 1.1 sample implementation changed the
  name of the "victim" being written to (was Efi-xxxxx, now EFI-xxxxx), so
  previous versions of efibootmgr don't work with the new firmware.  This
  should fix that up.
- released v0.4.0-test2

* Fri Dec 7 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Removed read last sector ioctl hack, it's not needed anymore.  The
  kernel takes care of it for us with a new patch.
- Added test for valid PMBR, similar to parted and the kernel.
- Added test for returning size of block device as a u64.
- Added test for returning sector size as int, and use that.
- Changed GPT struct and member names to be more Linux-like.
- added -g option to force disk with invalid PMBR to be treated as GPT anyhow.
- released v0.4.0-test1

* Thu Aug 9 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Added some uniqueness to the MBR signature.
- removed ExclusiveArch from spec file
- released v0.3.4

* Mon Aug 6 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- applied patch from Richard Hirst <rhirst@linuxcare.com> to fix
  efichar_char_strcmp().


* Fri Aug 3 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- By request, warn when creating a new boot entry with the same name
  as another boot entry.
- released v0.3.3

* Mon Jul 30 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Added test for non-zero signature on MBR-style disks,
  and new -w flag to write a unique signature to the disk if so.
- released v0.3.3-test4
- Fixed counting of optional data length (extra args)
- released v0.3.3-test5

* Fri Jul 27 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Added test for running as root
- released v0.3.3-test3

* Thu Jul 26 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Unparse extra args being passed to bootloader too.
- released v0.3.3-test2

* Wed Jul 25 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Added -u option to pass extra args to the bootloader in unicode
  (default is to pass in ASCII)
- Added -t option to allow writing to a file (for testing)
- released v0.3.3-test1

* Tue May 22 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Applied patch from Andreas Schwab.  remove_from_boot_order() called
  read_boot_order() without checking the return status.
- Changed README to remove os loader args comment
- Changed efi_status_t to be unsigned long (not uint64_t) as per EFI
  spec.  This allows efibootmgr to be recompiled as a 32-bit or 64-bit app
  depending on its running on 32-bit or 64-bit Linux.  Note:  this changes
  the size of the structure returned in /proc/efi/vars to match the kernel
  implementation.  32-bit efibootmgr won't work on 64-bit Linux and vice versa.
- release v0.3.2

* Fri May 18 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- changed usage() to *not* let you think you can pass args to the OS
  loader
- release v0.3.1

* Fri May 18 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Padded HARDDRIVE_DEVICE_PATH out to please EFI Boot Manager.

  - replace __u{8,16,32,64} with uint{8,16,32,64}_t
  - use _FILE_OFFSET_BITS
  - fix a segfault
- release v0.3.0

* Tue May 15 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- initial external release v0.2.0
