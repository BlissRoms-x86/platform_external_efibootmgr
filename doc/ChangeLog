* Thu Jan 3 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- added back in read last sector IOCTL hack, but only after read() fails.
- released v0.4.0-test4

* Thu Jan 3 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- more cleanups
- released v0.4.0-test3
	
* Wed Jan 2 2002 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Changed PROC_DIR_EFI to PROC_DIR_EFI_VARS
- write_variable() now searches /proc/efi/vars for a variable that's not
  the one being written.  The EFI 1.1 sample implementation changed the
  name of the "victim" being written to (was Efi-xxxxx, now EFI-xxxxx), so
  previous versions of efibootmgr don't work with the new firmware.  This
  should fix that up.
- released v0.4.0-test2
	
* Fri Dec 7 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>

  kernel takes care of it for us with a new patch.
- Added test for valid PMBR, similar to parted and the kernel.
- Added test for returning size of block device as a u64.
- Added test for returning sector size as int, and use that.
- Changed GPT struct and member names to be more Linux-like.
- added -g option to force disk with invalid PMBR to be treated as GPT anyhow.
- released v0.4.0-test1

- released v0.3.3-test2

* Wed Jul 25 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Added -u option to pass extra args to the bootloader in unicode
  (default is to pass in ASCII)
- Added -t option to allow writing to a file (for testing)
- released v0.3.3-test1

* Tue May 22 2001 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
- Applied patch from Andreas Schwab.  remove_from_boot_order() called
  read_boot_order() without checking the return status.
- Changed README to remove os loader args comment
- Changed efi_status_t to be unsigned long (not uint64_t) as per EFI
  spec.  This allows efibootmgr to be recompiled as a 32-bit or 64-bit app
  depending on its running on 32-bit or 64-bit Linux.  Note:  this changes
  the size of the structure returned in /proc/efi/vars to match the kernel
  implementation.  32-bit efibootmgr won't work on 64-bit Linux and vice versa.
- release v0.3.2
